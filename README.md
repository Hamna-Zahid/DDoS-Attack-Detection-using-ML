# DDoS Attack Detection using Machine Learning

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to detect Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks using machine learning techniques. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation.

## 📁 File Description

- `DDoS_attack.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook containing the complete code for detecting DDoS attacks.
  
## 🧠 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to identify DDoS attacks in network traffic using a supervised machine learning approach. The notebook includes:

- Loading and preprocessing dataset
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature selection and transformation
- Model building (e.g., Random Forest, Decision Tree, etc.)
- Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ddos-attack-detection.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
 ```bash
cd ddos-attack-detection
```

3. Open the notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook DDoS_attack.ipynb
```

📊 Dataset
This project uses the [CICDDoS2019 Dataset](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ddos-2019.html) provided by the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity (CIC). 

Please download the dataset from the official website and place it in the appropriate directory as referenced in the notebook.

✅ Results
The model achieves high accuracy in detecting DDoS attacks with minimal false positives.

Performance metrics and confusion matrices are provided in the notebook.

📌 Future Work
-Integrate with real-time data sources for live monitoring.
-Experiment with deep learning models (e.g., LSTM, CNN).
-Improve feature selection and model interpretability.
